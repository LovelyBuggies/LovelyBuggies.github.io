        <h2>Mean-Field Game for Autonomous Vehicles Navigation</h2>
        
        <p>
            Mean-Field Game is developed to study the decision-making strategy in multi-agent systems with very large populations by building a connection between stochastic modeling and distributed control. In the context of autonomous vehicle navigation, each vehicle acts as an agent and makes decisions regarding velocity control and route choice [<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372391123_Learning_Dual_Mean_Field_Games_on_Graphs">ref</a>] according to current population density distribution. The actions of all vehicles jointly trigger the evolution of density dynamics. This process repeats until it converges to the mean-field equilibrium. We proposed various approaches to address the practical challenges, such as fine granularity [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3545946.3598748">ref</a>], scalability and computational efficiency [<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/12/6/803">ref1</a>, <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4336/15/2/12">ref2</a>].<br><br>
