        <ul style="color: #664b8d">

            Patience, is the key in life.
        </li>
        <li>
            Achieving something in a wrong way is somehow even more terrible than nothing.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            "Life finds a way."" <paper>-- Jurassic Park</paper>
