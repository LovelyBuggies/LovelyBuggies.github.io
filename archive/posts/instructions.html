        <h4>What's Here</h4>

        I post my writings that are considered "nothing novel" but useful here.

    	<h4>Default Order</h4>
        
        The posts are in order of dates by default.

        <h4>Specialty</h4>
        
        <b>1: </b>CS students should learn.<br>

        <b>2: </b>Researchers in this area should know.<br>

        <b>3: </b>Researchers in this area want to skim.<br>

        <b>4: </b>Peers in this field should know.<br>

        <b>5: </b>Peers in this field want to skim.<br>

        <em>It does not necessarily mean difficulty.</em>

        <h4>Reading Time</h4>
		The reading time varies. People in relevant background would find it easier to read through. I try not to make the notes longer than a conference paper (~8 pages).<br>
