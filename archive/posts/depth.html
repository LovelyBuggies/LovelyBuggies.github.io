        <h4>How long does it take to read each post?</h4>
		The reading time varies. I use a lot of math in my writing, so those more comfortable with math might find it easier to read through, and I prefer not to have an exact reading time to spoil the fun of thinking.<br>

        <h4>Who are the authors?</h4>
        
        Most of the posts are written by me. I welcome any suggestions. If you want to cooperate on or cite these posts, please email me.<br>
