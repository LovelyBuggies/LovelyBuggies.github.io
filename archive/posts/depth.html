    	<h4>What is the default order?</h4>
        
        The posts are in order of dates by default.

        <h4>What does specialty mean in my posts?</h4>
        
        <b>1: </b>Fundamental and extensions, students should learn.<br>

        <b>2: </b>Core concepts and idea, researchers in this area should know.<br>

        <b>3: </b>Recent progress of core concepts, people who are doing similar projects would like to know.<br>

        <b>4: </b>Placeholder.<br>

        <b>5: </b>Specialized stuff, some detailed proofs of the paper I found interesting.<br>

        <h4>How long does it take to read each post?</h4>
		The reading time varies. I use a lot of math in my writing, so those more comfortable with math might find it easier to read through. Besides, I prefer not to have an exact reading time to spoil the fun of exploring more deeply.

        <h4>Who are the authors?</h4>
        
        Most of the posts are written by me. I welcome suggestions, and if you contribute, thereâ€™s a chance to be included in the acknowledgments or authorship.
