        <h4>How long does it take to read each post?</h4>
		The reading time varies. I use a lot of math in my writing, so those more comfortable with math might find it easier to read through. Besides, I prefer not to have an exact reading time to spoil the fun of exploring more deeply.<br>

        <h4>Who are the authors?</h4>
        
        Most of the posts are written by me. I welcome suggestions, and if you contribute, thereâ€™s a chance to be included in the acknowledgments or authorship.<br>
