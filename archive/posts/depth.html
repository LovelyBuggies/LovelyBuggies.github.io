    	<h4>What is the default order?</h4>
        
        The posts are in order of dates by default.
        <br>



        <h4>What does specialty mean in my posts?</h4>
        
        <b>1: </b>Fundamentals and extensions in a field, every CS student should learn.<br>

        <b>2: </b>Core concepts and idea in a subfield, researchers in the same field should know.<br>

        <b>3: </b>Context or progress of core concepts, researchers in the same field want to skim.<br>

        <b>4: </b>Details of a core specialization, research peers may want to dive into.<br>

        <b>5: </b>Details of an interesting work, research peers may want to skim.<br>
        <br>
        <em>Note that the specialty does not necessarily mean difficulty.</em>
        <br>

        

        <h4>How long does it take to read each post?</h4>
		The reading time varies. I use a lot of math in my writing, so those more comfortable with math might find it easier to read through, and I prefer not to have an exact reading time to spoil the fun of thinking.<br>

        <h4>Who are the authors?</h4>
        
        Most of the posts are written by me. I welcome any suggestions. If you want to cooperate on or cite these posts, please email me.<br>
